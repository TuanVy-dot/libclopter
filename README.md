# libclopter
---

This project is for my practice, I only have 1 month experience in C and is not confident about it better than libraries out there, but maybe try it?

Clopter is an easy to use commandline arguements parser.

**Version**: v1.0.0

**Key features**:

- Parser creation by a single function call

- Easily add arguements to a parser

- Parsing arguements using a single function call

- Easily access to arguements by the name with getters functions

- Extensible and easy to implement subcommands by simply create multiple parsers

- More to come!

You can check the tests file for example usage, but it fairly intuitive, I will add documentations later for more advanced use and understanding of implementation. The API is in api/ include it to use.

# Installation
---
I include a make file, so you can simply clone the repo and compile by yourself, note that I did not check for multiple platforms, so you may need some changes in the code or config.
